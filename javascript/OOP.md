### The `new` keyword does the following
1. It creates a new object. The type of this object, is simply object.
2. It sets this new object's internal, inaccessible, [[prototype]] property to be the constructor function's external, accessible, prototype object (every function object automatically has a prototype property).
3. It executes the constructor function, using the newly created object whenever `this` is mentioned.
4. It returns the newly created object, unless the constructor function returns a non-primitive value. In this case, that non-primitive value will be returned.

### `instanceof` 
* When `instanceof` is called, it checks the `.prototype` property of the given constructor and checks it against the {Prototype} chain of the given object. In other words, itâ€™s not dependent on the `.constructor` property.
