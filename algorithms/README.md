#Algorithms

###[Brute Force Fundamental Algorithms](./bruteforce.md)  
When nothing else works, use brute force. Useful for "quick and dirty" solutions for problems with relatively small inputs. Most algorithms described in the above section are relatively inefficient.

###[Dynamic Programming](./dynamicprogramming.md)  
Useful for problems where subproblems are overlapping and we can "cache" some of the answers.
